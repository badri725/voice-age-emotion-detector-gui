# üé§ Voice-Based Age and Emotion Detection (Male Voices Only)

This project uses machine learning to detect a speaker's **age group** and **emotion** from a voice clip ‚Äî only if the speaker is **male**. Female voices are automatically rejected. The application includes a clean, user-friendly GUI built using Tkinter.

## ‚úÖ Features

- üéØ Detects **gender** from audio
- üö´ Rejects **female voice** with a message
- üë¶üë®üë¥ Predicts **age group**:
  - Youth (0‚Äì18)
  - Adult (19‚Äì60)
  - Senior (61+)
- üòÑüò°üò≠ If senior, predicts **emotion** from 8 categories
- üñ•Ô∏è Tkinter GUI for selecting `.mp3` or `.wav` audio files

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

###  ‚úÖ Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### ‚úÖ Step 2: Train the Models (Optional)
You can run the training notebook to generate the required model files:

```bash
train_models_cleaned.ipynb
```

This will create .joblib model and scaler files in the saved_models/ directory:

model_gender_voice.joblib

model_age_voice.joblib

model_emotion_voice.joblib

And their respective scalers

You can skip this step if the saved models are already included.

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Run the GUI App
Use the following command to start the application:
```bash
python gui_voice.py
```
This will open the GUI window where you can upload a voice clip for prediction.

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Upload a Voice File
Supported formats: .wav or .mp3

‚úÖ If male voice:

The system will predict age group

If the person is a senior (age > 60), it will also predict emotion

‚ùå If female voice:

The system will reject the input and display:
"Upload male voice."
